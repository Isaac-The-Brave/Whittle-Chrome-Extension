# Whittle-Chrome-Extension
A Chrome extension I developed for an eventually abandoned project for a GPT-3 based research assistant which had some promise.

# Requires an API-KEY to run and it has to be modified on every single .js file that requires it
I'm well aware this isn't the clean way to do things, but this never went beyond production in my bedroom. All API keys have been rotated, so go wild.
This was all before I moved the back-end to PHP (Then later Python), so this was supposed to be an entirely independent app, but eventually after generating
considerable amounts of data, it was a shame to just copy paste my results, so I moved to a more robus PHP, MYSQL back-end hosted on AWS and then later Flask.

# Unpacked, every piece of code can be seen. 
Can be used on Chrome (Learn how to enable adding unpacked extensions).
