# Whittle-Chrome-Extension
A Chrome extension I developed for an eventually abandoned project for a GPT-3 based research assistant which had some promise.

# Requires an API-KEY to run and it has to be modified on every single .js file that requires it
I'm well aware this isn't the clean way to do things, but this never went beyond production in my bedroom. All API keys have been rotated, so go wild.

# Unpacked, every piece of code can be seen. 
Can be used on Chrome (Learn how to enable adding unpacked extensions).
